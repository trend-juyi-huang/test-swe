ðŸ“œ The SQL Linter for Humans
============================

Bored of not having a good SQL linter that works with whichever dialect
you're working with? Fluff is an extensible and modular linter designed
to help you write good SQL and catch errors and bad SQL before it hits
your database.

.. note::

    **SQLFluff** is still in an open Beta phase - expect potentially
    non-backward compatible api changes to happen with releases
    (particularly when major or minor version numbers increase).

Notable changes:

* **0.1.x** involved a major re-write of the parser, completely changing
  the behaviour of the tool with respect to complex parsing.
* **0.2.x** added templating support and a big restructure of rules
  and changed how users might interact with SQLFluff on templated code.
* **0.3.x** drops support for python 2.7 and 3.4, and also reworks the
  handling of indentation linting in a potentially not backward
  compatible way.
* **0.4.x** dropped python 3.5, added the dbt templater, source mapping and
  also introduced the python API
* **0.5.x** introduced some breaking changes to the API.
* **0.6.x** introduced parallel processing, which necessitated a big re-write
  of several innards
* **0.7.x** extracted the dbt templater to a separate plugin and removed the
  `exasol_fs` dialect (now merged in with the main `exasol`)
* **0.8.x** an improvement to the performance of the parser, a rebuild of the
  Jinja Templater, and a progress bar for the CLI
* **0.9.x** refinement of the Simple API, dbt 1.0.0 compatibility,
  and the official SQLFluff Docker image.

Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get started just install the package, make a sql file and then run
SQLFluff and point it at the file. For more details or if you don't
have python or pip already installed see :ref:`gettingstartedref`.

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install sqlfluff
    $ echo "  SELECT a  +  b FROM tbl;  " > test.sql
    $ sqlfluff lint test.sql
    == [test.sql] FAIL

    L:   1 | P:  14 | L006 | Operators should be surrounded by a single space unless at the start/end of a line
    L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace
