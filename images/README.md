# SQLFluff image assets

The logos, both as png and svg files are available here for use when referencing the project.

Contributions are welcome to these files in addition to contibutions to the codebase
of the project. This is especially useful if you have graphic design skills, but before
planning any large scale changes, do raise an issue for discussion on GitHub to ensure
that your planned changes are likely to be accepted.

With that in mind please follow some of the following guidelines:
- Be mindful that these files are linked to in several places, including the main
  `README.md` file which generates the pypi profile for the project. Don't remove or
  rename files without being mindful of this.
- If you edit the `svg` files, please re-generate the corresponding `png` files accordingly.
- Please use https://svgcrop.com/ and https://tinypng.com/ to crop and minimise `svg`
  and `png` files before committing.
